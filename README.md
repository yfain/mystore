# Develop a simple mystore app in Angular 5

**Angular 5/Bootstrap 4: two workshops**

This repo contains materials from my two workshops. 
"Angular Applied"  contains instructions and slides of my 3-hour workshop where we build an app with Angular and Bootstrap with the hard-coded data on the client.  "Angular for Java Devs" is a one-hour workshop  where the Angular app gets the data from a Spring Boot server.
